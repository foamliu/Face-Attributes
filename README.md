# Face-Attributes

Deep Face Attributes.


## DataSet

CASIA WebFace DataSet, 494,414 faces over 10,575 identities.

## Dependencies
- PyTorch 1.0.0

## Usage

### Data wrangling
Extract images, scan them, to get bounding boxes and landmarks:
```bash
$ python pre_process.py
```

Image alignment:
1. Face detection(MTCNN).
2. Face alignment(similar transformation).
3. Central face selection.
4. Resize -> 112x112.
